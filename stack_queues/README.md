STACKS, QUEUES - LIFO, FIFO
This program presents the user with four options:

Push the element
Pop the element
Show
End
It waits for the user to input a number.

If the user selects 1, the program handles a push(). 
First, it checks to see if top is equivalent to SIZE - 1. If true, "Overflow!!" is displayed. 
Otherwise, the user is asked to provide the new element to add to the stack.
If the user selects 2, the program handles a pop(). 
First, it checks to see if top is equivalent to -1. If true, "Underflow!!" is displayed. 
Otherwise, the topmost element is removed and the program outputs the resulting stack.
If the user selects 3, the program handles a show(). 
First, it checks to see if top is equivalent to -1. If true, "Underflow!!" is displayed. 
Otherwise, the program outputs the resulting stack.
If the user selects 4, the program exits.
Execute this code to push() the number "10"onto the stack:
