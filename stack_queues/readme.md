Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Never forget a test
Background Context
Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
Starting from today:
Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first,
before you actually code anything
The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think
about all possible cases
trongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of
them!
