Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Never forget a test
Background Context
Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
Starting from today:
Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first,
before you actually code anything
The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think
about all possible cases
trongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of
them!
Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General
Why Python programming is awesome
What’s an interactive test
Why tests are important
How to write Docstrings to create tests
How to write documentation for each module and function
What are the basic option flags to create tests
How to find edge cases
RSA Factoring Challenge
 By: Julien Barbier
Background Context
Before you continue reading, start this song in the background :)
We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents.
 It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. 

ur mission should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server
so that we can decode the encrypted documents.
This project is NOT mandatory at all. It is 100% optional.
Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average.Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average.
Your score won’t get hurt if you don’t do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!

Requirements
General
You can choose the language of your choice.
OS needs to be Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS/
Tasks
0. Factorize all the things!
s many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
Usage: factors <file>
where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
One number per line
You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1
You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number
The file will always end with a new line1~
Output format: n=p*q
one factorization per line
p and q don’t have to be prime numbers
p and q don’t have to be prime numbers
p and q don’t have to be prime numbers
