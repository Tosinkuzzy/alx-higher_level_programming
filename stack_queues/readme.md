Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Never forget a test
Background Context
Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
Starting from today:
Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first,
before you actually code anything
The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think
about all possible cases
trongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of
them!
Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
Resources
Read or watch:
doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)
doctest – Testing through documentation
Unit Tests in Python
Unittest module
Interactive and Non-interactive tests
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General
Why Python programming is awesome
What’s an interactive test
Why tests are important
How to write Docstrings to create tests
How to write documentation for each module and function
What are the basic option flags to create tests
How to find edge cases

Background Context
Before you continue reading, start this song in the background :)
We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents.
 It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers.
